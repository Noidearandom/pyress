# A terminal RSS app

This is a terminal RSS application.
It's very basic at the moment, for now it loads the RSS link feeds from the file
`config.example` in the project directory.

The entries will be opened in the default browser.

## Installation

Simply get the code, install all the required libraries:
```
# pip install -r requirements.txt

```

And run it:
```
# pyress/pyress.py
```
